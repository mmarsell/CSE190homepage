                                <h3>General Overview</h3>
                                <p>When designing this site, we felt simplicity was key. We wanted to ensure that it was easy to navigate,
                                    easy to understand, and intuitive to use. We realized that when desiging a website for a university class,
                                    mobile layout and performance are incredibly important, as many students check class information on their
                                    phones and on the go. Therefore, we decided to use Bootstrap as a framework to ensure a more mobile-friendly
                                    experience.
                                    <br></br>
                                    To help with our mobile-oriented design, we decided to utilize "cards" throughout the webpages, which we
                                    think creates a sleeker, more concise, and more intuitive mobile experience (with a specific focus on scrolling, rather than navigating tabs). 
                                    Additionally, when building this
                                    site we implemented many of the optimization techniques we learned throughout CSE 190, the specifics of which
                                    you can see above in the associated tabs. Given the size and nature of our webpage, the opimizations we made were fairly light,
                                    but as we learned in class, everything counts!
                                    <br></br>
                                    You can find the Lighthouse analysis of this site below:
                                </p>
                                <a class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" href="../images/performance.pdf" role="button">Performance score</a>
                              </div>
                              <div class="tab-pane" id="htmlTab" role="tabpanel">
                                <h3>HTML Optimizations</h3>
                                <p>With the pages, we wanted to focus on simplicity and succintness. Several times we either combined pages or 
                                    scrapped pages altogether in-order to decrease our overall shipping size. At the end of our development, we
                                    utilized an html minifier to remove all unneccessary whitespace and redundant tags, further decreasing the size
                                    of our html pages. 
                                    <br></br>
                                    As we have seen through the course, images can often cause performance slow-downs. Thus we made it a priority
                                    to compress all our local images (using tools like TinyJpg). We decided to keep them in either .png or .jpg format, although we could have 
                                    seen potentially higher compression savings if converted to webp, but currently webp is not supported across all 
                                    broswers and we didn't want to alienate a group of users. 
                                </p>
                              </div>
                              <div class="tab-pane" id="cssTab" role="tabpanel">
                                <h3>CSS Optimizations</h3>
                                <p> You may have noticed that our styles.css file is fairly small, this is because we decided to utilize
                                    many of the pre-included css styles provided by Bootstrap and fontawesome. One interesting take-away that
                                    we learned was that the animated background is pure css, and requires no javascript (which many animations do).
                                    We've found its better to do things with just pure css and html if possible, to avoid potential problems and slow-downs 
                                    that come with lots of javascript. 
                                    <br></br>
                                    Additionally, we used a css minifier to reduce our overall file size and load time, similar to our html optimizations.
                                </p>
                              </div>
                              <div class="tab-pane" id="jsTab" role="tabpanel">
                                <h3>Javascript Optimizations</h3>
                                <p> When designing this site, we wanted to limit our use of Javascript, to ensure fast performance and universal accessibility. 
                                    Thus the Javascript we did use was to load the Bootstrap and Jquery libraries, as well as to display a loading animation and
                                    make fetch requests to Reddit, in order to retrieve the top posts from the r/ProgrammerHumor subreddit. 
                                    <br></br>
                                    Again, similar to CSS and HTML, we made sure to minify our JS after development, to squeeze the most amount of performance out.
                                    We wanted to ensure that the website was extremely lightweight, hence our limited use of Javascript.
